This code is used to obtain a version of the yolov8 model with pre-trained
weights that can be used with the implementation of the network present in
this repository.

The user must provide the version of the model he intends to use on the
command line (available options are "n", "s", "m", "l", "x").
The desired model is downloaded and each model parameter is copied into the
model state dictionary initialized via our yolov8 implementation.
The model state dictionary is finally saved in the pytorch .pt format.
